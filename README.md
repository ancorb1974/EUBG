***
My set up for EUBG is making multiple battlegroups in their own PBO so they are interchangable and you can use what Battlegroup you want.

I am using mostly basic Bohemia models and vehicles, I do ask other modders if I can use their mods if it really have a big input to the EUBG mod.

For weapons I am using the standard Bohemia weapons with the apex update there are a lot of new usable weapons.
I did change the names of them to be get that feeling.

This is the reason I don't have any required mods, If this will change in the future, it can but I am trying to keep the requirements to a minimum.
I do use some mods that are included in the mod like the F18 from saul & NH 90 from Aplion.
EUBG will also use vehicles and weapons from all ArmA 3 DLC's, so if you want the full EUBG experience get the full DLC pack for ArmA 3.

# Nordic Battleground

[Nordic BattleGroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_Battlegroup)

The first Battlegroup is going to be the Nordic Battlegroup with 7 participating countries, with each their own tasks 

![](http://i.imgur.com/s4wqqVy.png)
* Sweden   :   ±1900
* Ireland  :   ±170
* Latvia   :   ±150
* Finland  :   ±60
* Estonia  :   ±50
* Lithuania:   ±50
* Norway   :   ±50

The main force is Sweden they have the most boots on the ground.

Ireland  has ISTAR (Intelligence & Recon).

Latvia has the QRF.

Finland has the airwing with the [NH 90](https://forums.bistudio.com/topic/178769-hafm-nh90-helicopter/), Troop transport and Medevac, and [F 18](https://forums.bistudio.com/topic/154948-fa-18-super-hornet-and-su-35s-flanker-e/) the reason I am using the F 18 is that there is no Saab Gripen mod and in my initial research it said they als ouse the F 18.
Its has also some ground units to provide security for the heli's.

Norway, Lithuania & Estonia provides security on different levels.

The 3 big ones have the most units and assets, the security countries will have less units and assets.
Each country wil have their own marker and flag.
I try to make custom weapons from the standard ArmA 3 weapon, so they may differ from the original ones but are as close as it gets with out compromising to much on the mod.
